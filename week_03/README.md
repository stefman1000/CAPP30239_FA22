Data Source: Census Bureau, American Community Survey, tabulated using IPUMS, https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group

Historical data on migration, immigration, and urban/rural status, along with demographic indicators

Want to track the development of urbanization in the US and how it tracks with demographic changes

Main data points: Race, Immigration Status, Urban/Rural, and recent migration status

Census changed the ACS variables it collects many times over the decades, some variables not avialable or changed/incompatable between years (not an issue post 2000, big issue beforehand)
