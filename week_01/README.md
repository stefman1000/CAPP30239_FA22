I'm a second year MSCAPP student from nyc. I studied pure math undergrad here at Uchicago which was fun and interesting but useless, so I'm back here to learn some actual practical skills. I don't really know what area of policy I'd like to go into yet, kind of interested in too many and hoping to narrow it down with electives.  I'm also half-french but lived in the US most of my life. I really like the subreddit /r/dataisbeautiful and i'm hoping that maybe my final project is something I could proudly post there. Looking forward to a great quarter.
